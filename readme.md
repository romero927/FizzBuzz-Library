# FizzBuzz Examples in Multiple Programming Languages

This repository contains implementations of the classic FizzBuzz problem in various programming languages. FizzBuzz is a simple programming task often used in software developer job interviews.

## What is FizzBuzz?

FizzBuzz is a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, it prints "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, it prints "FizzBuzz".

## Languages Included

This repository includes FizzBuzz implementations in the following languages:

1. Python
2. JavaScript
3. Java
4. C++
5. Ruby
6. C#
7. Go
8. Swift
9. Kotlin
10. Rust
11. PHP
12. TypeScript
13. Scala
14. Perl
15. Haskell
16. Lua
17. R
18. Prolog
19. Erlang
20. Clojure
21. x86 Assembly (Linux, 32-bit)
22. SQL (PostgreSQL)
23. MATLAB
24. COBOL
25. Fortran

## How to Use

Each implementation is contained in its own file, named according to the language (e.g., `fizzbuzz.py` for Python, `fizzbuzz.js` for JavaScript, etc.). To run an implementation, follow these general steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary compiler or interpreter installed for the language you want to run.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the file.
3. Run the file using the appropriate command for that language.

For example:

- For Python: `python fizzbuzz.py`
- For JavaScript (using Node.js): `node fizzbuzz.js`
- For Java: `javac FizzBuzz.java` then `java FizzBuzz`

Please note that some languages may require additional setup or have different run commands.
